# Review and Future Work

## Review of Findings

This project set out to develop a predictive model for heart disease using various machine learning techniques. The models tested—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest—showed promising results, with Logistic Regression emerging as the best-performing model with an AUC of 0.931. However, the project did not fully achieve the initial goal of 95% accuracy, as the best result obtained was approximately 90% with Logistic Regression.

### Key Strengths of the Model:
- High recall (0.92) and F1 score (0.86), indicating the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying patients with heart disease.
- The ROC curve demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, showing that the model can differentiate well between patients with and without heart disease.

### Limitations Identified:
- **Sample Size**: The dataset consisted of only 303 samples, which is relatively small for training robust machine learning models. The limited data might have constrained the model's ability to generalize effectively to unseen patients.
- **Model Performance**: While the Logistic Regression model performed well, it did not reach the target accuracy of 95%, indicating room for further improvements.

## Suggestions for Improvement

To enhance the model's performance and reliability, several strategies could be considered:

1. **Increase the Sample Size**:
   - Expanding the dataset by collecting more samples or using data augmentation techniques could help the model learn more robust patterns, ultimately improving its predictive power.
   - Additional data could also come from other heart disease datasets, which can be combined with the current dataset after proper preprocessing and normalization.

2. **Explore Advanced Models**:
   - **CatBoost and XGBoost**: These gradient boosting algorithms often outperform traditional models on tabular data, especially when there are complex, non-linear interactions between features.
     - **CatBoost**: Known for its handling of categorical features, it could capture intricate relationships in the clinical data more effectively.
     - **XGBoost**: A highly efficient gradient boosting implementation that can optimize model performance through advanced regularization techniques, feature importance analysis, and fine-tuning capabilities.
   - These models could potentially uncover patterns that Logistic Regression and Random Forest models might miss.

3. **Improve Current Models**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, such as interaction terms or polynomial features, could provide the models with more relevant information.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further refining hyperparameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization could lead to performance gains, especially for complex models like Random Forest or KNN.
   - **Ensemble Techniques**: Combining models using ensemble techniques (e.g., stacking, bagging, or boosting) could balance the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, leading to improved accuracy.

4. **Use Cross-Validation More Extensively**:
   - While cross-validation was utilized with `cv=5`, experimenting with different folds or using techniques like stratified k-folds could help in better understanding the model's performance across different subsets of the data.

5. **Leverage Domain Expertise**:
   - Collaborating with medical professionals could provide insights into the clinical relevance of features, allowing the models to incorporate more meaningful transformations or feature selection methods that align with real-world medical understanding.

## Conclusion

The project provides a strong foundation for predicting heart disease using machine learning models but also highlights the need for further work to achieve optimal results. By expanding the dataset, exploring advanced models, refining existing techniques, and integrating domain knowledge, future iterations of this project could achieve the targeted accuracy and potentially be used as a valuable tool in clinical settings.
