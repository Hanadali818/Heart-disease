# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

This project uses Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to develop models that predict heart disease based on clinical parameters.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: To predict the presence of heart disease using clinical features.
- **Dataset**: Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
- **Performance**: Best model (Logistic Regression) achieved 90% accuracy and AUC of 0.931.

## Key Findings
- Logistic Regression performed best, with high recall (0.92) and F1 score (0.86).
- Chest pain type and exercise-induced heart rate changes were significant predictors.
  
## Future Work
- Increase the dataset size for better generalization.
- Explore advanced models like CatBoost and XGBoost.
- Enhance current models with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook to train models and view results.
